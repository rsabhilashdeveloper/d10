# Microsoft Document Viewer

Microsoft Document Viewer intends to provide a new format for the File field type.
This format presents the file as a fully rendered object within a web page - i.e.
it displays the contents of the file as appropriate to its filetype (Adobe Acrobat .pdf,Microsoft Word .doc/.docx, Microsoft Excel .xls/.xlsx, 
Microsoft Powerpoint .ppt/.pptx), using the Microsoft Document Viewer.

## Configuration

To use this field format, add a File field to a new or existing content type (such as Basic Page) on the content type's Manage Fields form. 
The File field type provides only one widget type - File - so select that. On the content type's 'Manage Display' form, there will be a drop-down select list of available display formats for the File field. 
To display the file within the embedded Microsoft Docs viewer, choose the 'Embedded Microsoft Document Viewer Formatter' format.
The document viewer is styled using the mdoc-viewer-field.html.twig template.By default, the viewer's width is 100% and its height is 600px, with a frameborder zero. Provided field settings to change the width and height.
